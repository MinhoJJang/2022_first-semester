        Aladdin, which has emerged as the hottest musical in New York, is
        Klook's first pick! <br />
        If you listen to the splendid stage directing of Disney Productions that
        you can't take your eyes off of
        <br />and the familiar music that you've heard before, you'll fall in
        love with the performance in an instant.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Aladdin, a musical that sings of infinite possibilities with one lamp
        and three wishes, is the best for everyone from adults to children.<br />
        A new song created for the musical by Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken
        also provides another level of enjoyment.
